# Arcade-2024:
This repository contains a collection of Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, primarily focused on cryptography. Most of these challenges were authored by me in preparation for the Cipher Room challenge, which is a part of the Arcade 2024 event. The event is hosted and organized by the Skill and Tell Scientific Club at ENSIA.
